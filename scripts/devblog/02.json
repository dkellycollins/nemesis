{"Title":"Houston, we have a triangle","Author":"Devin Kelly-Collins","DatePosted":"10-16-2014","Content":"<p>So much for the once a week update. I would like to say that updates from here on out will be more frequent and consistent but to be honest I don&#39;t trust myself that much at this point.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that development of nemesis has started in earnest. If you checkout the <a href=\"https://github.com/dkellycollins/nemesis\">repo</a> right now the sample game should be able to draw a triangle. Not much, I know.</p>\n\n<p>Much of my time up till this point has been finding and learning a good framework to facilitate good design. I settled on using <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">requirejs</a>, which if you have not looked at, you should. I am using requirejs because it does seem to offer the best of both worlds solution. Developers can write their javascript in a modular fashion, bringing all the benefits that it provides. Then, using requirejs&#39; optimizer, code can be served in a single file.</p>\n\n<p>Another awesome thing about requirejs is their plugins. One that I am using is <a href=\"https://github.com/requirejs/text\">text</a> which allows you to require text files. This, along with the <a href=\"https://github.com/millermedeiros/requirejs-plugins\">json</a> plugin, provides quite the range of flexibility.</p>"}
